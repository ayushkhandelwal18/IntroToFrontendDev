        <p id="Startup">
    A startup is a young company that focuses on developing and bringing a unique product or service to market.
    Startups are important because they can help solve problems and meet needs that traditional businesses can't. 
    They can also create jobs and drive economic growth. 
    <br>
    Startups are different from other new businesses because they intend to grow beyond the founder. 
    They typically don't have a fully developed business model and often lack capital. </p>
